I want you to build a full-stack AI Export Agent web application that helps exporters automate their work.

Core Purpose:

Exporters currently go through long and complex procedures: generating invoices, filling export forms, checking HS codes, tracking shipments, and preparing compliance documents. I want this app to act like a virtual export assistant that can do most of the work for them.

Features Needed:

Frontend (React + Tailwind + Vite)

Clean and professional UI with a dashboard layout.

Pages:

Home/Dashboard – Overview of exporter tools.

Invoice Generator – Form where users input buyer/seller details, products, quantity, price, etc. Then download invoice as PDF.

Export Forms Assistant – Step-by-step AI-guided form filling (e.g., Shipping Bill, Bill of Lading, Packing List).

AI Chat Assistant – Exporters can chat with the AI to ask questions about procedures, documentation, compliance, or customs.

Shipment Tracker – Placeholder section for entering tracking numbers (future feature).

Backend (Node.js + Express)

Expose secure API routes:

/api/generate-invoice → generates invoice PDF (use pdfkit or puppeteer).

/api/fill-form → AI-assisted form completion (calls OpenAI API securely).

/api/ask-ai → Chat endpoint for export-related queries.

Must hide the OpenAI API key in server-side .env.

Serve frontend build files after deployment.

AI Integration

Use OpenAI GPT API (via backend only) for:

Generating proper export documents.

Explaining procedures (compliance, HS codes, shipping rules, etc.).

Assisting exporters with step-by-step instructions.

PDF Generation

Allow users to generate downloadable invoices and forms in PDF format.

Example: When exporter fills buyer, seller, product details → generate professional invoice.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React + Tailwind + Vite.

Backend: Node.js + Express.

Database: (optional) MongoDB or JSON for saving invoices.

Deployment: Should run on Replit with one-click "Run" support.

Deliverables:

/frontend → React + Tailwind UI.

/backend → Node.js Express server with APIs.

README.md → Instructions to run locally and deploy.

Workflow:

Exporter logs in → chooses "Generate Invoice" → fills form → downloads PDF.

Exporter chooses "Fill Export Forms" → AI asks questions → fills standard forms automatically.

Exporter uses AI chat → asks about procedures, compliance, or best practices.

Example User Flow:

Exporter signs in.

Goes to "Invoice Generator".

Fills buyer/seller info and product details.

Clicks Generate Invoice → PDF downloads.

If they want to export → AI guides them step by step through forms & compliance.

They can ask AI anything about exporting in the Chat section.

Build this entire project in Replit with working code.
