🚨 IMPORTANT: My app is currently broken. The dashboard features are not working at all and show blank white pages. An “invalid website” message appears at the bottom right. Nothing is functioning properly.

Here is the full list of problems and what I want fixed:

🐞 Current Issues

Dashboard sections are showing blank white pages

“Invalid website” error shows on the bottom right

Contacts/CRM: fails to load

HS Code Finder: not working

Forms & History: fails to load

Settings: fails to load

No proper error handling or user feedback

UI lacks proper structure or responsive design

🧰 Fixes & Features Required
1. Global App Structure & Routing

Fix all frontend routes so they correctly render pages:

/app/dashboard

/app/contacts

/app/hs-finder

/app/forms

/app/settings

Ensure React Router is properly configured with error boundaries.

Add a global navigation sidebar or top menu so users can move between features easily.

Ensure protected routes are working — only logged-in users can access these pages.

2. Contacts / CRM Module

Build a fully functional CRM:

Add, edit, delete contacts (name, company, email, phone, address, role: buyer/supplier).

Display contact list in a clean, responsive table or cards.

Show loading states and error messages.

Save all contact data to Supabase.

3. HS Code Finder

Build working search input (product name + country).

Use OpenAI API or a placeholder API to return HS Code and duty rates.

Display results in a table with code, description, and duty %.

Add search history (stored in Supabase).

4. Forms & Document Generator

Fix forms page so user can:

Create commercial invoices, packing lists, and proforma invoices.

View form history in a clean list.

Download generated documents as PDF with company footer.

Fix server.js backend to properly generate PDFs.

5. Settings Page

Add UI to update and save:

Company name, address, VAT number, registration number.

Company logo upload.

Contact email & phone.

Save settings to Supabase.

6. UI/UX Enhancements

Apply consistent branding with EXPORTAGENT LTD colors (modern business theme — blue & white with accents).

Add a clean layout, spacing, and icons for all pages.

Make the platform mobile responsive.

Add proper loading indicators and error toasts/snackbars.

7. Error Handling & Alerts

Fix the “invalid website” issue.

Add global error handler for failed API calls.

Show helpful messages instead of blank pages.

8. Payment Plan Integration (Stripe)

Ensure free users have limited usage (e.g., 5 documents per month).

Pro users get unlimited access.

Add upgrade prompt if free user hits the limit.

9. Testing & Verification

After implementing everything, test each page:

Add contact, edit contact, delete contact.

Search HS code, see results, view history.

Generate and download invoice/packing list.

Update settings, see company info reflected in invoice.

Navigation works smoothly.

Ensure no blank white pages or console errors remain.

🏁 Goal: Make the platform fully functional, stable, visually professional, and ready for real paying users (exporters).
🎯 Final result: All modules should work end-to-end, navigation should be smooth, UI should look professional, and errors should be handled gracefully.
