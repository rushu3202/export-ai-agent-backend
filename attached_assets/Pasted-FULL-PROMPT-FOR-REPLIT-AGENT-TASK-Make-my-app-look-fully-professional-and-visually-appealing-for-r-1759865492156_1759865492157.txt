FULL PROMPT FOR REPLIT AGENT

TASK:
Make my app look fully professional and visually appealing for real exporters and small business users.
Keep all existing functionality (login, signup, profile, billing, Stripe checkout, Supabase, etc.) intact.
Focus on frontend design, branding, and layout polish using a clean SaaS look.

🎯 DESIGN GOAL:
Transform the UI into a sleek, modern SaaS dashboard — similar to Stripe, Linear, or Notion.
The app should look like a real commercial product people would pay to use.
