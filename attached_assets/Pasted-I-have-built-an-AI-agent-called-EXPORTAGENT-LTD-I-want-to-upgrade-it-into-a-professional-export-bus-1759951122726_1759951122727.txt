I have built an AI agent called EXPORTAGENT LTD.
I want to upgrade it into a professional export business platform with monetizable features.
Please build and structure the app step by step with clean, modern UI, secure backend, and Stripe payment integration.

🧰 Tech Stack: React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), MongoDB (database), Stripe (payments), OpenAI API (AI features).

🏗️ Core Features to Build / Upgrade:

🧾 Smart Export Documentation Generator

Auto-generate commercial invoices, packing lists, proforma invoices, shipping docs.

Allow users to fill a simple form → generate PDF with company logo & footer.

Save generated documents in the database for future access.

Allow download as PDF or Excel.

🌍 HS Code & Duty Finder (AI)

Input product name → AI/DB suggests correct HS code & duty info.

Allow free 5 searches per user, then upgrade to Pro.

📦 Shipment & Compliance Tracker

Dashboard to manually add shipments and track status.

Stages: created → shipped → customs → delivered.

Automated reminders or alerts for shipment updates.

🤖 AI Export Advisor

Integrated AI chatbot to answer export/import related questions (e.g., required docs, taxes, rules for different countries).

Example: User types “export textiles to UAE” → chatbot replies with full step-by-step export procedure.

🧑‍💼 Client & Supplier CRM

Section to add, edit, and store buyer/supplier information.

One-click autofill for document generator.

Export contacts to Excel.

💳 Billing & Payment System

Integrate Stripe for user subscriptions: Free, Pro (£29/month), and Business (£79/month).

Auto-generate invoices with payment link.

🌐 Multi-Language Support

Add basic support for English + other languages (start with Hindi and Arabic).

👤 Authentication & User Dashboard

Secure user login/signup (email + password).

Add this footer to the public website, invoice PDFs, and email templates.

🪙 Monetization Rules:

Free plan: limited document generation + limited HS code searches + basic chatbot.

Business plan (£79/month): everything + CRM + shipment tracker.

🔐 Security:

Protect OpenAI API key on backend only.

Stripe webhook for payment confirmation.

📲 UI Requirements:

Clean dashboard with side navigation (Documents, HS Codes, Shipments, CRM, AI Chat, Settings).

Use Tailwind CSS or Shadcn UI.

Mobile responsive.

✅ Please build this project step by step:

Set up backend routes & database first.
