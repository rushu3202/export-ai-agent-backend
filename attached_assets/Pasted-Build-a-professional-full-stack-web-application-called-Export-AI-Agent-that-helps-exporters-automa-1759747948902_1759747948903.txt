Build a professional full-stack web application called “Export AI Agent” that helps exporters automate their daily export operations.

The app should have a modern SaaS dashboard interface, built using:

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion

Backend: Node.js + Express

PDF generation: pdfkit or jspdf (for export invoices)

AI: OpenAI API (for export-related guidance and automation)

🧭 Project Overview

Export AI Agent should act like a digital assistant that automates everything for exporters — including invoice generation, form filling, AI chat guidance, and shipment tracking.

🎨 Frontend (React)

Create a professional dashboard layout with:

Sidebar navigation with links:

🏠 Dashboard

🧾 Invoice Generator

📋 Export Forms

💬 AI Chat Assistant

🚢 Shipment Tracker

Header: “Export AI Agent – Automate Your Exports”

Color theme: Blue & White (business/professional look)

Font: Sans-serif (clean and minimal)

Animations: Smooth transitions between pages (Framer Motion)

Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

🧾 Dashboard Page

Show the following stats dynamically (start with mock values):

Invoices Generated

Forms Completed

AI Queries

Shipment Tracked

Add a “Get Started” button linking to the Invoice Generator.

💼 Invoice Generator Page

Input fields for:

Seller Name

Buyer Name

Items (either JSON input or Add Item form)

“Generate PDF” button → sends data to backend /generate-invoice endpoint.

On success → downloads the invoice PDF file.

Backend should:

Use pdfkit to generate a professional-looking invoice with:

Header: “Export Invoice”

Seller & Buyer details

Table of items (description, qty, price, total)

Footer: “Powered by Export AI Agent”

📋 Export Forms Assistant Page

Form to fill export documents (like shipping bill, packing list, etc.)

Connect to /export-forms endpoint (AI-powered)

Backend uses OpenAI API to generate filled forms or summaries.

💬 AI Chat Assistant Page

Chat interface (like ChatGPT)

Users can ask:

“How do I get an export license?”

“Explain the process for export customs clearance.”

Backend endpoint /chat

Uses OpenAI API for answers in friendly, simple tone

Keeps short memory of conversation

🚢 Shipment Tracker Page

Input tracking number

Display mock shipment updates (AI-generated for now)

Backend /track returns simulated responses like:

“Shipment left port Mumbai – ETA 7 days.”

⚙️ Backend (Node + Express)

Endpoints:

POST /generate-invoice → Generates PDF and sends it back

POST /export-forms → AI generates filled export forms

POST /chat → AI replies to export-related queries

POST /track → Returns mock shipment updates

Use:

express

pdfkit

cors

body-parser

dotenv (for OpenAI API key)

openai (for AI responses)

Make sure the backend:

Works seamlessly with the React frontend

Returns PDFs or JSON responses correctly

🌐 Deployment

Host on Replit with a public domain

Frontend built with npm run build and served via Express from dist folder

The final app URL should look like:
https://export-agent-ai.replit.app

✅ Final Result

A working Export AI Agent app with:

Dashboard interface

Working invoice generator (PDF downloads)

AI chat answering export questions

Form assistance and shipment tracker (mock working)

Fully responsive design

Professional and ready to demo or sell

🧩 Stretch Goals (Optional)

If possible, also include:

Login/signup (with Firebase or JWT)

Save previous invoices in history

Dark mode toggle

📦 Deliverables

Complete frontend (React + Tailwind)

Backend (Node.js + Express)

Working build command: npm run build

Working backend start: node server.js

Fully connected UI + backend with tested endpoints

💬 Tone for the AI Assistant

The AI should sound professional yet friendly, using short, clear sentences.
Example style:

“Hello! I’m your Export AI Assistant. I can help you generate invoices, fill export forms, and track shipments. What would you like to do today?”
